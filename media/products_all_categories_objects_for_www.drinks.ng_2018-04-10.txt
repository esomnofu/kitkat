This wine is composed of 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Franc. The vineyard of Chateau La Tour du Pin was once an important part of the massive, 200 hectare, St. Emilion estate, Chateau Figeac. For numerous reasons, Figeac divided and sold their land in multiple transactions in the late 19th century.

From the first pour, it\u2019s clear that Martell Caractere is something special. Golden red in colour, each sip reminds you what a great cognac should embody. Boasting a strong punch of flavour with subtle notes of jasmine, dark pepper and tobacco, Martell Caractere is the perfect accoutrement to conclude any memorable evening. The Martell Caractere\u00a0is a young blend, so no wonder we notice a very fruity aroma \u2013 with an idea of oak. The finish is rough\u00a0but short.
